Partially inspired by [this JohnnyBoi tweet][tweet], I wanted to see how my average car speed compared to the pros.

- Per-game average car speed.

## üíΩ Installation

1. Download the [latest release][release].
3. Copy `Speedometer.dll` to `/plugins` your BakkesMod folder.
4. _(Optional)_ You may need to copy the `speedometer.set` file to `/plugins/settings` if settings
   aren't showing up in the `Plugins` tab.
5. Open RL and BakkesMod.
6. Open the BM console (`~`) and run:
    - `plugin load speedometer`
